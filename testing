# Views on testing software:

## Why do we test our software as engineers

To make sure that our output is going to be what we expected and therefore we can be confident
that our client will be happy with the product because of its quality,'
and the company will save money in a long term.

## What best practices are there for testing software

Test Driven Development - write your test first
Behaviour Driven Development - always test your code

There are 3 options to do the testing:
unit testing - to check small parts of code(jest)
integration testing - to check how parts of code interact with each other
ent to end testing - to check how the code as one big unit works(cypress)

## Where you have applied those best practices

Doing the Morse translator using Jest and Cypress
Doing the project as a group of 8 people, for the sport nutrition company
we always tried to implement the testing so we would be confident in the quality of the product
